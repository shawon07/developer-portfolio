            <p>I want to make Fakibaji knowledge as an art.I have several Friends who are trying to
                make me successful in Fakibaji line.They give me encourge.But my parents are very
                much frustrated with my doings.But i am adamant.am a person who is positive about every aspect of life.
                There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like
                to
                think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I
                like
                to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind
                coming
                from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought
                experiment
                
                 <br>
